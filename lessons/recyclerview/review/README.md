# Lecture

To quote an applicable movie reference:

**Colette:** I know the Gusteau style cold. In every dish, Chef Gusteau always has something unexpected. I will show you. I memorize all his recipe.

**Linguini:** (writing in notebook) Always do something unexpected.

**Colette:** No. Follow the recipe.

**Linguini:** But you just said that...

**Colette:** (interrupts) No-no-no-no. It was *his* job to be unexpected. It is *our* job to...

**Colette, Linguini:** (together, as Linguini rewrites the advice) ... follow the recipe.

**-- Ratatouille, 2007**
