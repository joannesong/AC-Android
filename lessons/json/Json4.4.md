# Json And the language of the data. 

#### Overview: Intro

JSON! Not Jason! but said the same way, stands for Javascript Object Notation. And it is the default way to send data across the internet. Think of it as a string that contains data that you can turn into Java objects for you to use. You can send and recieve this data over a network depending on your purposes.

The bulk of the information you need can be found in the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) (history and such)

You can also take a look at the [lesson](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-0/blob/master/lessons/week-4/2015-04-04-secret-kung-fu-masters-JSON-quick-start-guide.md) I had when I learned this subject. It looks like the API needs a key now but we won't be focusing on network connections yet anyway. It's more for context.

In our lesson I will show practical examples of how to create and parse JSON objects and the motivation behind using them.
