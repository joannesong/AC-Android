# Lecture

As we've seen with Activities, the only way to include different layouts for an activity, is to use the <include> tag in your layout xml, or to use an intent to switch between activities. However, there are ways to have multiple Activity-like views, with their own view logic, both attached to, and indepented of, an activity within your app.

## What is a Fragment?

According to the [Android Docs](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html):

*"A Fragment represents a behavior or a portion of user interface in an Activity. You can combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build a multi-pane UI and reuse a fragment in multiple activities. You can think of a fragment as a modular section of an activity, which has its own lifecycle, receives its own input events, and which you can add or remove while the activity is running (sort of like a "sub activity" that you can reuse in different activities)."*

## The Fragment Lifecycle

The Fragment Lifecycle is similar to that of the Activity Lifecycle, in that it goes through various stages throughout its lifecycle, and can shift between these states depending on the actions of either the user, or the device itself. However, fragments have additional lifecycle callback methods that Activities do not, primarily because they can only exist within an activity, and must respect its parent's lifecycle as well.

|Fragment Lifecycle Callback Method|Description|
|:-----------:|:-----------------|
|onAttach()|This method will be called first, even before onCreate(), letting us know that your fragment has been attached to an activity. You are passed the Activity that will host your fragment|
|onCreateView()| The system calls this callback when it’s time for the fragment to draw its UI for the first time. To draw a UI for the fragment, a View component must be returned from this method which is the root of the fragment’s layout. We can return null if the fragment does not provide a UI|
|onViewCreated()| This will be called after onCreateView(). This is particularly useful when inheriting the onCreateView() implementation but we need to configure the resulting views, such as with a ListFragment and when to set up an adapter|
|onActivityCreated()| This will be called after onCreate() and onCreateView(), to indicate that the activity’s onCreate() has completed. If there is something that’s needed to be initialised in the fragment that depends upon the activity’s onCreate() having completed its work then onActivityCreated() can be used for that initialisation work|
|onStart()|The onStart() method is called once the fragment gets visible|
|onPause()|The system calls this method as the first indication that the user is leaving the fragment. This is usually where you should commit any changes that should be persisted beyond the current user session|
|onStop()|Fragment going to be stopped by calling onStop()|
|onDestroyView()|It’s called before onDestroy(). This is the counterpart to onCreateView() where we set up the UI. If there are things that are needed to be cleaned up specific to the UI, then that logic can be put up in onDestroyView()|
|onDestroy()|onDestroy() called to do final clean up of the fragment’s state but Not guaranteed to be called by the Android platform|
|onDetach()|It’s called after onDestroy(), to notify that the fragment has been disassociated from its hosting activity|

## Why use Fragments?

Although it is tempting to think of designing an entire app with many different activities, your manifest will fill up with their declarations pretty fast. Fragments are like activities that can be swapped out many times, without having to leave the current activity. You can have only one activity running at any given time, but you can have a seemingly infinite number of fragments running at any given time.

Fragments give us the opportunity to create dynamic UI elements within our application. 

Fragments are available as widgets we can use within our XML Layout files. However, they are rarely if ever used that way. Often, fragments are instantiated at runtime, and replace the contents of a view container.

Typically, when creating an app where Fragments are the UI elements most often used to host the views visible to the user, a main fragment is added, or replaces the contents of a view container, which typically takes up the entire screen. In the layout XML for our Main Activity, we can add a FrameLayout, within the root view, which will be used to "swap out" fragments as necessary:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    tools:context="nyc.c4q.fragmentstesting.MainActivity">

    <FrameLayout
        android:id="@+id/main_container"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent">
    
    <TextView
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            android:gravity="center"
            android:text="This textview is in the Main Activity"
            android:textSize="50sp"/>

    </FrameLayout>

</LinearLayout>
```

Because the FrameLayout is set to "match_parent" for both width and height, it will take up the whole screen. We can now fill the screen with our fragment at runtime.

```java
package nyc.c4q.fragmentstesting;

import android.support.v4.app.FragmentManager;
import android.support.v4.app.FragmentTransaction;
import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.os.Bundle;

import nyc.c4q.fragmentstesting.Fragments.ButtonFragment;
import nyc.c4q.fragmentstesting.Fragments.MainFragment;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        MainFragment mainFragment = new MainFragment();
        FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager();
        FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();
        fragmentTransaction.replace(R.id.main_container, mainFragment);
        fragmentTransaction.commit();
    }
}
```

To create a fragment dynamically within a view, we first need to create the class and corresponding layout.

Right-click inside your main project folder, and create a new project folder called "fragments" - all lowercase. This will help to separate concerns between files. Next, right-click within that folder to create a new fragment. Android Studio allows us to create fragments out-of-the-box, just like activities, with minimal setup.

After right-clicking in the "fragments"'s project folder, select New > Fragment > Empty Fragment - where you will then be prompted to make a few selections. Name your new Fragment "MainFragment", make sure "Create Layout XML?" is checked off, but DESELECT "Include fragment factory methods", as well as "Include Interface callbacks. Then select "Finished".

Let's go to our MainFragment.java file - we can see that we have a n empty public constructor, and an onCreateView() method, but that's about it. We can create a fragment just fine with these parts, but if we want to reference views in this fragmnet, we'll have to alter the onCreateView() method a bit.

First, let's add a field variable, to hold a reference of the view we will be inflating into our MainActivity's FrameLayout:

```java
private View rootView;
```

Next, within our onCreateView() method, we will assign the view we will be inflating to this field, then return this field in the end:

```java
@Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
                             Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        rootView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_main, container, false);
        return rootView;
    }
```

Why do we do this? We do this because previousy, the view was simply inflated and returned - but we want to be able to reference views to it, just like we might in the onCreate() of an activity. Now, we can use ```rootView``` by calling ```findViewById()``` on it, before we return the view to be inflated:

```xml
<FrameLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
             xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
             android:layout_width="match_parent"
             android:layout_height="match_parent"
             tools:context="nyc.c4q.fragmentstesting.fragments.MainFragment">

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/main_fragment_textview"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="This is the Main Fragment"
        android:textSize="50sp"
        android:layout_gravity="center"
        android:gravity="center"/>

</FrameLayout>
```

And in our onCreateView within our fragment:

```java
@Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
                             Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        rootView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_main, container, false);
        TextView textView = (TextView) rootView.findViewById(R.id.main_fragment_textview);
        return rootView;
    }
```

Let's go back to the onCreate() method of our MainActivity, so that we can create our fragment programmatically:
* First, instantiate our fragment:
```MainFragment mainFragment = new MainFragment();```

* Next, assign a FragmentManager:
```FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager();```

A FragmentManager manages Fragments in Android, in relation to how transactions are handled between fragments. A transaction is a way to add, replace, or remove fragments.

* Now, let's create a FragmentTransaction, using our FragmentManager, to replace the view within the FrameLayout:
```java
FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();
fragmentTransaction.replace(R.id.main_container, mainFragment);
```

Finally, we commit our transaction (just like we do when editing SharedPrefernces), and let the FragmentManager handle everything at runtime. The result should look something like this:

![](overlapping_views.PNG)

Oh no! It looks jumbled! This is actually a good thing - it's showing us that the fragment has replaced, and been layered onto the MainActivity's FrameLayout! When we delete the TextView from the MainActivity's Layout XML, from within the Frame Layout, this overlapping issue should disappear!

Let's create a new Fragment called ButtonFragment.java, with the following code:

```java
package nyc.c4q.fragmentstesting.fragments;


import android.os.Bundle;
import android.support.v4.app.Fragment;
import android.support.v4.app.FragmentManager;
import android.support.v4.app.FragmentTransaction;
import android.view.LayoutInflater;
import android.view.View;
import android.view.ViewGroup;
import android.widget.Button;

import nyc.c4q.fragmentstesting.R;

public class ButtonFragment extends Fragment {

private View rootView;

    public ButtonFragment() {
        // Required empty public constructor
    }

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
                             Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        rootView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_button, container, false);

        Button button01 = rootView.findViewById(R.id.button01);
        button01.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                PictureFragment pictureFragment = new PictureFragment();
                FragmentManager fragmentManager = getActivity().getSupportFragmentManager();
                FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();
                fragmentTransaction.replace(R.id.main_container, pictureFragment).addToBackStack("picture");
                fragmentTransaction.commit();

            }
        });
        
        return rootView;
    }
}
```

And this will be its corresponding XML:

```xml
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
              xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
              android:layout_width="match_parent"
              android:layout_height="match_parent"
              android:orientation="vertical"
              android:gravity="center"
              tools:context="nyc.c4q.fragmentstesting.fragments.ButtonFragment">

    <Button
        android:id="@+id/button01"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="display image"/>

</LinearLayout>
```
We'll also have to create a new Fragment called PictureFragment.java, which will hold an imageView in its XML layout file:

```xml
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
              xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
              android:layout_width="match_parent"
              android:layout_height="match_parent"
              android:orientation="vertical"
              tools:context="nyc.c4q.fragmentstesting.fragments.PictureFragment">

    <ImageView
        android:id="@+id/picture_imageview"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"/>

</LinearLayout>
```

Let's change our code in our MainActivity.java onCreate(), to accomodate for the new fragment:

```java
@Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        ButtonFragment buttonFragment = new ButtonFragment();
        FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager();
        FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();
        fragmentTransaction.replace(R.id.main_container, mainFragment);
        fragmentTransaction.commit();
    }
```

Huzzah! We created one fragment with a button that, when pressed, will move to another button! However, when we press the back button, the app closes :sob:

How can we fix this? By adding the new fragment to something called the "BackStack" - which allows us to go back to the last fragment created, just like calling pop() on a Stack implementation! However, unlike a regular stack, you are not returned the view that is popped, you are merely brought back to the previous fragment. Let's add our new fragment to the backstack now:


```java
button01.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                PictureFragment pictureFragment = new PictureFragment();
                FragmentManager fragmentManager = getActivity().getSupportFragmentManager();
                FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();
                fragmentTransaction.replace(R.id.main_container, pictureFragment).addToBackStack("picture");
                fragmentTransaction.commit();

            }
        });
```

Now, when the back button is pressed, it will go back to the previous fragment, as expected! We use the string "picture", so that FragmentManager can tell the difference between Fragments in the backstack. Just remember, if you add your main fragment to the backstack, if you press the back button while that fragment is loaded, it will disappear (be popped), and show us the hosting activity, which should be empty. Don't do that, though - that's weird.

Just like how Activities can pass information between them with intents and intent extras, so can fragments, by using bundles. Let's say we wanted to add an EditText to our button fragment that, when pressed, will pass the contents of that EditText to the new fragment called RandomFragment.java - Let's do that now:



```xml
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
              xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
              android:layout_width="match_parent"
              android:layout_height="match_parent"
              android:orientation="vertical"
              android:gravity="center"
              tools:context="nyc.c4q.fragmentstesting.fragments.ButtonFragment">

    <EditText
        android:id="@+id/fragment_edittext"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>

    <Button
        android:id="@+id/button01"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="send bundle"/>

    <Button
        android:id="@+id/button02"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="display image"/>


</LinearLayout>
```

Now the layout for the RandomFragment:

```xml
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
              xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
              android:layout_width="match_parent"
              android:layout_height="match_parent"
              android:gravity="center"
              android:orientation="vertical"
              tools:context="nyc.c4q.fragmentstesting.fragments.RandomFragment">

    <TextView
        android:id="@+id/random_textview"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:textSize="50sp"
        android:text="Random Value"/>

</LinearLayout>
```

Next, let's update the onCreateView() in our ButtonFragment:

```java
@Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
                             Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        rootView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_button, container, false);

        Button button01 = (Button) rootView.findViewById(R.id.button01);
        Button button02 = (Button) rootView.findViewById(R.id.button02);
        editText = (EditText) rootView.findViewById(R.id.fragment_edittext);
        button01.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                PictureFragment pictureFragment = new PictureFragment();
                FragmentManager fragmentManager = getActivity().getSupportFragmentManager();
                FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();
                fragmentTransaction.replace(R.id.main_container, pictureFragment).addToBackStack("picture");
                fragmentTransaction.commit();

            }
        });
        button02.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {
                RandomFragment randomFragment = new RandomFragment();
                FragmentManager fragmentManager = getActivity().getSupportFragmentManager();
                FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();
                String editTextContents = editText.getText().toString();
                Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
                bundle.putString("random", editTextContents);
                randomFragment.setArguments(bundle);
                fragmentTransaction.replace(R.id.main_container, randomFragment).addToBackStack("random");
                fragmentTransaction.commit();
            }
        });
        return rootView;
    }
```

We also added these four lines specifically:

```java
String editTextContents = editText.getText().toString();
Bundle bundle = new Bundle();
bundle.putString("random", editTextContents);
randomFragment.setArguments(bundle);
```

When we create a bundle, we are creating an object that will pass on other objects in key/value pairs to whatever fragment receives it. we can then call ```Bundle bundle = getArguments();```, and extract those values by calling the keys that were used to put them in:

```java
package nyc.c4q.fragmentstesting.fragments;


import android.os.Bundle;
import android.support.v4.app.Fragment;
import android.view.LayoutInflater;
import android.view.View;
import android.view.ViewGroup;
import android.widget.TextView;

import nyc.c4q.fragmentstesting.R;

public class RandomFragment extends Fragment {

    private View rootView;
    private TextView textview;

    public RandomFragment() {
        // Required empty public constructor
    }


    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
                             Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        // Inflate the layout for this fragment
        rootView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_random, container, false);
        textview = (TextView) rootView.findViewById(R.id.random_textview);

        Bundle bundle = getArguments();
        String textFromEditText = bundle.getString("random", "");
        textview.setText(textFromEditText);

        return rootView;
    }

}
```

Excellent! We can easily create fragments, replace views, add fragments to a backstack, and pass data between fragments with bundles! Good work!
