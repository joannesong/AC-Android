# Title: LinkedList

Data structures

# Objectives

- Review linked lists and implementations of their common methods. 
- Practice traversing linked lists to search for a target value and/or return the list length.
- Understand the difference between singly vs. doubly linked lists.
- Understand a circular linked list and its implementation.

## Linked Lists

## Linked Lists

- A **linked list** is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.

- Simplest form: each element is comprising of two items - the **data** and a **reference** to the next node. 

```java
public class Node {
    Node next;
    Object data;
}
```

---

## Linked Lists 

- The last node has a reference to `null`. 

- The entry point into a linked list is called the **head** of the list. It should be noted that head is not a separate node, but the reference to the first node. If the list is empty then the head is a `null` reference.

- A linked list is a dynamic data structure, allocating the needed memory while the program is running. 

- The number of nodes in a list is not fixed and it can grow and shrink on demand. 

- It does not allow direct access to the individual elements. If you want to access a particular item then you have to start at the head and follow the references until you get to that item. 

---

## Traversal

A visit to every node of a data structure is called a **traversal**.

To traverse a singly-linked list, we begin at the first node and follow each next link until we come to the end:

```
// Pseudocode

 current node = first node
 while current node is not null
     (do something with current node's data)
     current node = next node
```

---

## Linked List

We can put all the operations around the nodes in a class, and call it LinkedList

```java
// Linked List Class
class LinkedList
{
    Node head;  // head of list
 
    /* Node Class */
    class Node
    {
        String data;
        Node next;
          
        // Constructor to create a new node
        Node(String d) {data = d; next = null; }
    }
}
```

---

## Linked List: Adding an item to the list

This method inserts a new Node at front of the list. 
It is defined inside LinkedList class shown above.
New items are added at the head of the list.

```java
/* This function is in LinkedList class.  */
public void add(String new_data)
{
    // create the new node
    Node new_node = new Node(new_data);
 
    // make next of new Node the head 
    new_node.next = head;
 
    /* 4. Move the head to point to new Node */
    head = new_node;
}
```

---

## Linked List: Traverse and Print list

This function prints contents of linked list starting from head

```java
public void printList()
{
    Node tnode = head;
    while (tnode != null)
    {
        System.out.print(tnode.data+" ");
        tnode = tnode.next;
    }
}
```

---

### Exercises:

1. Write a method `listLength(Node node)` that receives the head of a singly linked list and returns the number of nodes in the linked list. What is the worst-case runtime complexity of your algorithm?

```java
Node next;
Object data;

public Node(Object data) { 
	this.value = data;
	this.next = null ;
} 

Node node = new Node("Apple");
node.next = new Node("Orange") 
node.next.next = new Node("Banana");
node.next.next.next = new Node("Carrot");
node.next.next.next.next = new Node("Beet");
 
listLength(node); // returns 5 
``` 

---

2. Write a method called `searchLinkedList(Node head, Object target)` that receives the head of a linked list and target search value, and returns `true` if the target is in the list, or `false` if the target is not in the list. What is the worst-case runtime complexity of your algorithm?

```java
searchLinkedList(list, "Apple"); // returns true
searchLinkedList(list, "Pear"); // returns false

```

## Types of linked lists


### Singly-linked lists

In a singly-linked list every node contains some data and a link to the next node, which allows to keep the structure.

---

### Doubly-linked lists

In a doubly linked list, each node contains, besides the next-node link, a second link field pointing to the 'previous' node in the sequence.

![doubly linked](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Doubly-linked-list.svg/1220px-Doubly-linked-list.svg.png)

---

### Circular linked lists

A **circular linked list** is a variation of linked list in which the first element points to the last element and the last element points to the first element. Both singly -linked lists and doubly-linked lists can be circular.

![circular linked](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Circularly-linked-list.svg/700px-Circularly-linked-list.svg.png)

- In a singly-linked list, the `next` pointer of the last node points to the head node.
- In a doubly-linked list, the `next` pointer of the last node points to the head node and the previous pointer of the head node points to the last node.

---

### Exercises

1. Write a method `insertAfter(Node node, Node newNode)` that inserts `newNode` directly after the existing `node` in a singly-linked list.

2. Modify your `listLength(Node list)` and `searchLinkedList(Node list, Object target)` solutions to handle a circular singly-linked list.

3. Can you traverse a singly-linked list backwards? What about a circular singly-linked list?
